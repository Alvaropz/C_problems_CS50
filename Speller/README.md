# Speller
#Code and description partialy provided by CS50. Week 5 - Speller.

Important to note: These files are the main code. The one I wrote is "dictionary.c".

This program will read a text and, via a hash function and linked lists, it will check how many words there are in the text, how many match with a dictionary provided, how many are mispelled and how efficient your code is.

Implement a program that spell-checks a file, a la the below, using a hash table.

$ ./speller texts/lalaland.txt
